#  A Simple Portfolio Website

## Description
This project is a simple, responsive webpage designed to demonstrate HTML and CSS skills.  
It includes a header with navigation, a main content area, and a footer.  
The webpage features hover effects, a sticky header, and responsive layout techniques.


## Features
- Semantic HTML structure: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`.  
- Responsive layout using `vw`, `vh`, `%`, and `max-width`.  
- Sticky header with Flexbox alignment (`display: flex`, `justify-content: space-between`, `align-items: center`).  
- Interactive hover effects with `transition` and `text-shadow`.  
- Inline-block elements for side-by-side layouts.

## Steps to Build
1. **Setup project:** Created HTML and CSS files and linked them.  
2. **HTML structure:** Added header with logo and navigation, main sections, and footer.  
3. **CSS styling:**  
   - Reset default margins and paddings with `* { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; }`.  
   - Styled header with sticky positioning and Flexbox layout.  
   - Applied hover effects with `transition: 0.3s ease;` and `text-shadow`.  
   - Used responsive units (`vw`, `vh`, `%`) and `max-width` for readability.  
4. **Final adjustments:** Tested responsiveness and alignment across screen sizes.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

I deployed this website using **GitHub Pages**, which hosts static sites directly from a GitHub repository.

### Steps I followed:

1. **Uploaded the project to GitHub**
   - Created a new repository  
   - Added all project files  
   - Committed and pushed everything to the `main` branch  

2. **Enabled GitHub Pages**
   - Opened the **Settings** tab of the repository  
   - Selected **Pages** from the left sidebar  
   - Under **Source**, selected:
     ```
     Branch: main
     Folder: /root
     ```
   - Clicked **Save**  

3. **Waited for deployment**
   - GitHub took a few seconds to publish the site  
   - A live link appeared at the top of the Pages settings  

4. **Accessed the live site**
   The final site becomes available at:
